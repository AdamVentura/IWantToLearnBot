	"focus" : "Hi, I'm a bot. If I read your title correctly, you want to learn how to stay focused. This could mean one of two things, you want to improve your attention span. Or you want to improve your life focus. If it's the former, I reccomend you start two new habits: a meditation habit and a reading habit. With both of these habits, it's best to do it every day and start small and slowly build up. If you want to improve your life focus, I would also reccomend you to create habits. That is, because you losing your life focus is likely a lack of motivation. You don't need motivation to act on habits, only to create them. For more information about the science of habits, I reccomend the book The Power of Habit. For more information regarding habit creation, I reccomend the book Tiny Habits as well as Atomic Habits.
